# Python code to run OCR on images of text in HEIC files (i.e. photos with your phone)

## Description 

The .py file will convert text from all the images in a folder. It will produce a file, output_text.txt, with the transcribed text. 

## Packages to install

brew install tesseract  
brew install libheif  
pip install pyheif pillow pytesseract  

brew install imagemagick  # optional but useful  
brew install python  # if you don't already have python installed  
 
## Note

For ease, run the .py file in the same folder as your images.
